#### lib选择（够用即可，不需要深入掌握）

## 学习选择指标

#### github ★ 数量
> GitHub star counts are loosely correlated with a library’s popularity, but people often star libraries that look interesting and then never return.

#### google趋势查询
> Google Trends is helpful for seeing trends at a rough level, but doesn’t offer data with enough granularity to accurately compare a particular set of tools.

#### stack overflow问题数量
> Stack Overflow question volume is more of an indication of how confused people are using a technology rather than how popular it is.

#### NPM下载量
> NPM download stats is the most accurate measure of how many people are actually using a particular library. Even these might not be totally accurate since this number also includes automatic downloads like those done in continuous integration tools.

#### state of js调查数据
> Surveys like the State of JavaScript 2017 are helpful for seeing trends among a large sample size (20,000 developers).

### 用户 和 浏览器网络交互流程:

> 1.The user enters a URL in the browser address bar
> 2.The browser takes the domain name from the URL and requests the IP address of the server from a DNS.
> 3.The browser creates an HTTP packet saying that it requests a web page located on the remote server.
> 4.The packet is sent to the TCP layer which adds its own information on top of the HTTP packet. This information is required to maintain the started session.
> 5.The packet is then handed to the IP layer which main job is to figure out a way to send the packet from you to the remote server. This information is also stored on top of the packet.
> 6.The packet is sent to the remote server.
> 7.Once the packet is received, the response gets sent back in a similar manner.

## 前端的要素

#### 掌握基础（数据结构、新思想）
> Learn everything you can about the JavaScript language itself, its bad parts and good parts, and all the modern features it recently gained. Learn how to build and use the various data structures in JavaScript.

#### 了解原理（单线程、执行栈、浏览器DevTool等）
> Learn the JavaScript runtimes like Node and Browsers and learn how they are single-threaded. Learn their APIs and limitations. Learn about the event loop. Learn about the VM’s call stacks. Get comfortable with browsers’ DevTools.

#### 学习前后端交互 （浏览器工作原理、按需加载）
> Learn how to share code between clients and servers and preload initial data. Learn how to minimize JavaScript loading and parsing in browsers. Learn how to load JavaScript on demand.

#### 学习FP（FP概念、declarative 与 imperative、pure function等）
> Learn the merits of functional programming and use its concepts where you can. Learn how to be declarative instead of imperative when you can.

#### lib选择（够用即可，不需要深入掌握）
> Learn about small JavaScript libraries which do one thing and do it well. Pick libraries with the smallest API and don’t focus on the APIs but rather on what these libraries enable you to do.

#### 学习如何构建scalable API（GraphQL）
> Learn how to build scalable data APIs (take a look at GraphQL).

#### 强化css（Flexbox 与 Grid布局、响应式设计）
> Learn the power of CSS and how to use it to minimize your applications JavaScript code. Learn the new Flexbox and Grid layouts. Learn about UI-responsive design.

#### 学习静态类型（Typescript 或 Flow）
> Learn how to add static types to JavaScript with TypeScript (or Flow) and learn where you should focus on types vs testing.



## 学习的标准

#### github ★ 数量
> GitHub star counts are loosely correlated with a library’s popularity, but people often star libraries that look interesting and then never return.

#### google趋势查询
> Google Trends is helpful for seeing trends at a rough level, but doesn’t offer data with enough granularity to accurately compare a particular set of tools.

#### stack overflow问题数量
> Stack Overflow question volume is more of an indication of how confused people are using a technology rather than how popular it is.

#### NPM下载量
> NPM download stats is the most accurate measure of how many people are actually using a particular library. Even these might not be totally accurate since this number also includes automatic downloads like those done in continuous integration tools.

#### state of js调查数据
> Surveys like the State of JavaScript 2017 are helpful for seeing trends among a large sample size (20,000 developers).
